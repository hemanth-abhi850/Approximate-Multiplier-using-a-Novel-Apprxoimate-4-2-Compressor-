# Approximate 4:2 Compressors for Energy-Efficient Multipliers

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of novel **approximate 4:2 compressors**, developed using **input reordering circuits** and **input combination probabilities**. These designs are optimized to reduce hardware complexity while maintaining acceptable precision, making them particularly suitable for **image processing applications**.

The proposed compressors are integrated into the design of **approximate multipliers**, offering significant energy savings compared to existing designs. 

## Key Features

1. **Input Reordering Circuits**: Simplify hardware design by optimizing the arrangement of inputs.
2. **Energy-Efficient Designs**: Four proposed multiplier designs:
   - **MUL1**: Saves **22.75%** energy.
   - **MUL2**: Saves **21.95%** energy.
   - **MUL3**: Saves **11.57%** energy.
   - **MUL4**: Saves **8.95%** energy.
3. **Target Applications**: Tailored for **image processing tasks**, where some degree of inaccuracy is tolerable.

## Comparative Advantage

The proposed designs outperform existing approaches, such as the design by Kong and Li (2021), in terms of energy efficiency while maintaining sufficient precision for real-world applications.

## Applications

- **Image Processing**: Suitable for operations requiring high performance and energy efficiency with tolerance for approximate computations.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use in systems prioritizing low power consumption, such as embedded devices and IoT.
